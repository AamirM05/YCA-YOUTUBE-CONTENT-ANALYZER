going to win this challenge the winning team is going to receive one point for this all right who's going I'm going yeah I think he has more upper body strength let's start this thing off with a bang I got it you got it I got it cuz he done wrestling this should be easy let's get this one point how much you bench bro more than them more than them my name is Jeff gum I was a 10-year US Navy SEAL I was a sniper you got it I got upper body I got a chest I think I can win this one I was chosen for the bench press I'm just going to rep it out until I got nothing left we're going to decide it was going to go first so we're going to play Rock pepper scissors Rock Paper Scissors Shoot B who's going first it's going first you're up all right come on you got this bro remember don't think just do it on you got this m the reason we thought Troy we win this is that he's a professional wrestler and has a background in gymnastics he definitely has the upper body strength especially compared to Jeff Troy started off strong completing 21 presses and we initially thought Jeff didn't send a chance but then this happened take those he take those he you got it I didn't touch it all year 28 Troy you failed us I need to get back in the gym bro R Navy SEAL can't lose to a bunch of pranksters hey to for this next challenge we're going to hang from this bar whoever hangs the longest wins this challenge whoever wins is going to receive two points all right boys who wants to do this one think I got it I spent 10 years as a Navy Seal in the special Warfare Community I was a medic and I deployed to the Middle East and support a global war on terror I think I got this Kevin seems confident but little does he know that back in the days I used to train calisthenics which is a body weight workout and I'm pretty good bending bars I could win this guy paper scissors he going to go first bro all right let's go based on Kevin's weight I didn't think he would last more than 30 seconds but he managed to hold on for 55 seconds almost a full minute I knew I was in trouble but to beat him I knew I had to make some sacrifices for the team oh it's getting heavy bro through the nose out through the mouth don't even think about it you see I've been gaining weight I'm not used to my weight but I think I still completed this was getting harder but I cannot let my team down getting heavy bro you got it where we at 5 more seconds yeah there we go we just got it we got it we got it we got it bro let go let go I told you I got you bro that calisthenic strength even if you don't work out you never lose the strength next challenge is tug of war whoever wins this challenge gets Five Points you boys ready bro you got to move bro 1 2 3 in tug of war and navy battle strategy and teamwork are key with armored and missile destroyers uniting to dominate the battlefield come on Bo oh oh yeah let's go 1 2 one 2 come on boys come on you're on you're let go to it I can't let [Music] go you're right you're right brother oh my God that's tough right there boy heels are the best of the best so this isn't really a challenge I've seen opto online boy can run so I know he's got strong legs but those guys are amateurs we're professionals we got this all day long for us this challenge was all about teamwork we weren't an individual out there work together and we knew we had itas you guys are making us look weak right now twin hey the beach you see that deadlifting whoever does more reps wins the winning team receives one point with time I don't have no upper body strength I don't have no lower body strength and I look did you not see all that I I can't do it look I'm going to keep you guys as a team spirit you know what I mean I'm going to be from the sidelines okay who's doing this challenge bro I got it frog man up I spent 13 years as a Navy SEAL officer multiple deployments in the global war on terror now I'm ready to take all that experience to this competition I'll do it but I need all the motivation I can get to that's a lot of damn weight we're going to get a point back let's get it no come on deadlift it's one of the big three compound lifts represents pure strength generally tall skinny guys are not good for deadlift but throw some weight on the bar and let's do this this is a lot of weight you go first this all right let's do it this competition is going to be interesting a Navy SEAL versus a former Marine catch larison seems pretty confident about deadlifting but even though Nova thought it was too much weight I think he has a great chance of winning this and getting us the point back one 2 9 10 25 that's what's up that's how frog men do it that's an easy way to get hurt 25 still alive here go I did 13 more I actually thought I was going hire me for for this challenge is pretty simple we're just going to do some arm wrestling whoever wins this receives one point who's doing this take it take it he's got the Rivalry

maybe I hey to be fair win 50 the Navy Seals are absolutely crushing us and have already earned eight points they have a strong chance of winning this competition but we still have three more challenges ahead I place the highest point challenge in the end just in case they outperform us they have no idea what's coming because the final challenge is my specialty these guys are absolutely destroying us we got the trench warfare rules for this challenge is either you get tapped out or you get thrown outside the Rope are we're going to do 2v2 for this one the winner gets three points

the return Road Prime Buffs join tide of honor an exclusive Naval Force signin event there you can claim a Navy officer plenty of upgraded resources for your Naval Force we made it easier for returning players to catch up with the prime Road buff event which offers abundant resources and Powerful Buffs yeah yeah for this last challenge we got a couple balloons around here and we're going to pretend each balloon represents a naval vessel from Warth that you can also use in the game in war path each Naval vessel has its own unique strengths and weaknesses a submarine can stealthily attack a aircraft carrier while anti-submarine freegate can hunt it down which in this case it creates unpredictable Naval battles this also enhances the importance of strategy providing players with a more balanced and competitive environment for this last challenge guys we're going to play Battleship but instead of sinking ships we're going to be popping these balloons cuz we're going to pretend these balloons are the ships each team is going to pick its own contestant and that contestant is going to gets seven darts whichever team pops more balloons is the winner and the winner gets 25 points you're just pissed I beat you and everything all day long we literally lost everything so this is 25 points we win they lose we're out we got smoked guys for sure we got smoked on this
