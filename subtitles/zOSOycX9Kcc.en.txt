opportunity to make some cash you guys got to understand bro like these people that work at Home Depot sometimes they don't get the job they might sit there for days and hours8 hours and they don't get to work cuz there's too many people or sometimes whenever they actually get the job people don't want to pay them they want to pay them less or just like ghost them so they do the job for free so

prankster bro so this is in my Niche I had to like give them a little bit of adrenaline but but obviously I had to bless them each segment was like 20 minute long from driving here doing our thing and
