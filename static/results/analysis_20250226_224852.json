  "generated_ideas": "1. Top Performing Content Patterns and Themes: \n   - The top-performing videos involve extreme activities, pranks, and challenges involving unexpected groups of people (ex. Home Depot workers, thugs, navy seals.)\n   - MUST WATCH: This phrase is repeatedly used in the top-performing video titles, indicating that it may draw views.\n   - Longer video lengths don't necessarily get fewer views.\n   \n2. Key Success Factors: \n   - Unexpected Scenarios: Viewers seem to be drawn to unfamiliar, surprising situations.\n   - High Stakes: The elements of danger, risk, and immense value (like a $5,000,000 movie) seem to entice viewers. \n   - Sensational Titles: The use of sensational titles attracts more viewers.\n\n3. Content Ideas: \n   - Pranking Five Star Restaurant as a FAKE CHEF! (MUST WATCH)\n   - Pro Skater Turns OFFICE WORKERS into Skate Pros!\n   - Confronting HARDENED CRIMINALS in Maximum Security Prison!\n   - Destroying a $10,000,000 ARTWORK as a FAKE ART CRITIC! (MUST WATCH)\n   - Going UNDERCOVER in the US ARMY!\n\n4. Suggested Titles, Descriptions, and Key Points:\n   - Title: \"Scaring Wall Street Bankers with FAKE STOCK CRASH! (MUST WATCH)\"\n     Description: Join me as I prank high-flying bankers with a fake stock market crash \u2014 their reactions will leave you in stitches!\n     Key Points: Introduction of the prank, execution, reactions, conclusion.\n\n5. Strategic Recommendations:\n   - Duration: Based on the data, duration doesn't significantly impact views. Keep videos to a minimum of 12 minutes, but feel free to extend if the content requires it.\n   - Upload Timing: Given that there's no directly observable pattern between upload timing and views, try uploading at different times and track which times result in the quickest view accumulation.\n   - Subtitles: Although none of the top-performing videos have subtitles, consider adding them as they can help reach a broader audience, including non-English speakers and those with hearing impairment.  \n   \nOverall, the strategy should continue focusing on extreme, risky scenarios involving unsuspecting individuals or groups. Keep the headlines sensational and high-stakes to attract views."
